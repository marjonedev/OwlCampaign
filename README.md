# README

This is the README for OwlCampaign, an email campaign platform. This platform
enables users to create an account and build email lists of their customers,
which they can use to communicate with their customers. We charge users based
on the size of the email list they have created or the number of emails that
they send every month.

* Email Templates / Designs

* Campaigns and the audience that the campaign is sent to.

* Contacts and the customers that are represented by the Contact.
